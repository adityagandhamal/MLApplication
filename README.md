# ML Web Application
### This is my first ML Web Application built using the Flask micro web framework, deployed using Heroku.
### The model is trained on the famous Iris Dataset, and thus predicts the species of a given flower.
#### You can view the application on <https://iris-species-predictor.herokuapp.com/>
